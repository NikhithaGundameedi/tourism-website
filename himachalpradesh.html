    Within the borders of the Indian States there exists hundreds, if not thousands, of versions of <br> America--each contributing an essential piece of the ever-evolving whole.

    For example, a trip to Washington, D.C. offers a glimpse into the modern-day lives of people who <br> make the wheels of government move forward-- just like those who helped establish  <br>the Nation’s capital in 1790. On a trip to DC today, you’ll get to see some of the oldest and most <br>important buildings in the country, such as The White House, the Lincoln Memorial,<br> the Washington Monument and the United States Capitol. Alongside <br>these establishments, you’ll find the many museums and exhibitions that represent the cultural <br>uprisings, revolutions and many influences that have always been part of the <br> American Narrative, as well. For a shortlist of those places, start with the <br>National Portrait Gallery, the Holocaust Memorial Museum and the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>
